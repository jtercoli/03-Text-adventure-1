This is a simple text adventure game that I created for my Game Technology class at Indiana University. 
The game takes place in a small house. There are four rooms that you can travel between. You must enter the commands 
that are listed in ALL CAPS, such as NORTH, READ, OPEN, and EAST. There are some "locations" which are actions that can
be performed, but some of the "locations" are rooms in the house. Enjoy the game, and beware of the basement!
